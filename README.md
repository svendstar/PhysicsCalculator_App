# PhysicsCalculator_App
Hi, i have an idea for a calculator app i want to create. It is like a normal calculator, but imbedded with all of the constants we use in physics. It shall also be able to do conversion of units very easily. Constants include: Plancks COnstant, boltzmanns constant, COnstant of universal gravitation, vacuum permetivity and permeability, speed of light, and many more.
